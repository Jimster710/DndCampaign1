## **Plot Points/ The Loose Thread**
1. Everyone roll a d6, everyone roll a d20. (d6 decides introduction order in tavern, d20 decides how vague the memory of the dungeon is)
18, 19, or 20- full visual representation of the map in roll 20. 
14-17-flash visual of the map in roll 20. Full voice. 
9-13- no visual, vague description. Full voice.
1-9- Vague memories of feelings. A fleeting memory of the name of the tavern. 
2. [[Overview & Introduction]] to the world, "[[dream sequence]]"
3. Setting Change, bring the first players to [[Chatz Tavern]].
	1. Character descriptions, LEAVE room for role playing. Slowly move along the plot. If need be, roll for bothered by dream. 
	2. If they want to speak to the bartender, his name is [[Chatz the Barkeep|Chatz]].
	3. Eventually ONLY if they don't find another reason to leave the town, bring in [[Radamis]].

## **NPCs**
Chatz
- He is blonde, typically bearded dwarf. 
- Start with head low, gruff frown face. Stare at the player. When time is right in California accent "Hey man welcome to Chatz, we got all sortsa brews for you. Welcome to Lochfeld man"
- PERHAPS work in that he is missing a bunch of barrels.
- If asked of news, he knows some farmers have complained of cows going missing. Probably wandering off because the fence and palisade aren't doing too well. Or it's RotThorn. (MAKE PLAYERS ASK ABOUT ROtTHORN)
- Ah man, RotThorn is making trouble again. He thinks he's like, the Captain of the thieves and bandits or something man.
