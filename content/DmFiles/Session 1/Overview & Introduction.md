The Autumn passes quickly. The Winter never long lingers-will anything of cosmic consequence  ever come to pass in the mortal realm?  Will desolation erase all that has been accomplished in our age? 


Our lives stretch before us. Most are idle and wither. But a chosen few-they are commanded to strike their mark. --The First Chronicler

(Show flaming quote)

A blessed rain brings forth life in the valley now. It was an age forgotten, a place held only the memory of the Chronicle. 

I am the Chronicler of the Tales of adventurers-of heroes and knaves alike. Evil and Good are tallied upon the Chronicle without distinction. Listen well. 



Our Tale begins in warm embrace of spring.
