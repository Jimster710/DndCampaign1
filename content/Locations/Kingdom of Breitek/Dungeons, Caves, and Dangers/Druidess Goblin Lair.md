You know the approximate location of the [[Druidess Goblin]]'s lair. The treasure map you found on the defeated goblins indicated that there is a magic item there!

You found the Druidess Goblin's lair-a place rotting of death. You found magically infused gunpowder in barrels at the transition from cave to dungeon, but were then rudely interrupted by explosive tile traps! After [[Saisu]] used his shield to activate several tiles and clear a path, the party was blocked by an iron door. After a failed flash of powder by [[Zalma Cindershine|Zalma]], the party successfully blasted the door open and gained entrance into the inner dungeon. 

> Oh, and there were several forms of light. Pebbles mostly. And nearly all of them were not stinky!

Inside of the inner dungeon, the brave adventurer's found an extraordinarily drunken dwarf sipping from a barrel and unbothered by the large door explosion. He was sitting in purple torchlight, enjoying an occasional sip from a nearby barrel. 

There was also a rug that tried to get a little too comfortable with Saisu and Zalma. Fortunately, that rug was reduced to rags. 

The drunken dwarf had two friends come to find him, but they were not smart enough to lay down their weapons. One of them was melted by [[Myastan Balasar|Balasar]]'s poison breath. The other was knocked out by [[Yosim Standengarden|Yosim]]'s staff.
