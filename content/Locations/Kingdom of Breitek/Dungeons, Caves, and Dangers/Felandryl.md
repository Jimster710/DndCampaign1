Felandryl was a prosperous elven city on the ancient sea that once covered the eastern half of the [[Bay of Larglyne]] region. [[Renna the Elven Dragonslayer]] hailed from this city, and fought [[Muldri]] the dragon. 

All that remains of Felandryl, like all of the ancient elven cities, are abandoned ruins scattered amongst the [[Kehrn Mountains]]. 

[[content/Locations/Kingdom of Breitek/Dungeons, Caves, and Dangers/Muldri's Rest|Muldri's Rest]], a canyon which contains the remains of [[Muldri]] the Dragon, can be found nearby.
