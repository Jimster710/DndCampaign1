Felandryl was a prosperous elven city on the ancient sea that once covered the eastern half of the [[Bay of Larglyne]] region. [[Renna the Elven Dragonslayer]] hailed from this city, and fought [[Muldri]] the dragon. 

All that remains of Felandryl, like all of the ancient elven cities, are abandoned ruins scattered amongst the [[Kehrn Mountains]].
