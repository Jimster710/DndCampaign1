Lady Sturmlith's Brothel is a place of ill-repute in the town of [[Lochfeld]]. It is guarded by a half-orc bouncer, and it is ran by the matron [[Lady Sturmlith]]. [[Zalma Cindershine]] is in negotiations to be employed there. [[Yosim Standengarden]] has unwittingly earned quite a LARGE reputation there. 

The brothel itself is a towering and colorful three story building with a full iron door, a grand entryway staircase, numerous rooms, street facing windows, and beautiful decor. The workers wear animal themed masquerade masks.
