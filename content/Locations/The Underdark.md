The Underdark is vast network of caves, tunnels, subterranean rivers, lakes, seas, and cities that stretch across [[The Continent]], but also across the entire mortal plane. The Underdark is home to a myriad of creatures altogether strange to surface dwellers. Notably, the Underdark is home to the Svirfneblin. Very few surface dwellers venture into the Underdark-even dwarves tend to stick to cave systems, mountainous tunnels, and the deep roads. 

The overlap between the dwarven deep road system and the upper dark is quite blurry, and this has led to significant conflict between the Svirfneblin Council and the Dwarven Guilds.


It is possible, although extremely dangerous, to cross under entire surface oceans using the Lower Dark. Even Svirfneblin (Deep [[Gnome|Gnomes]]) rarely attempt these types of crossings, and thus, ocean voyages are one of the few places outside of the Underdark where one can find Svirfneblin with frequency.
