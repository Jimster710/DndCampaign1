Renna was a famed Elven warrior. The [[Druidess Goblin Lair]] turned out to be the final resting place of Renna. [[Capt. Ros]], the Drunken Dwarf Rofri and the Cleric noted that they have not found her remains. 

Renna perished while defending the ancient elven city of [[Felandryl]] from [[Muldri]] the dragon. Fifty years later, she returned and helped drive the dragons away from [[The Continent]] during the [[Holy Calendar of Breitek|Age of Collection]].
