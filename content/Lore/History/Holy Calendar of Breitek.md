The Holy Calendar of Breitek (the original name may have just been "The Calendar" or "Allseason's Almanac") was initially developed by the druids in the [[Wood of Orains]], before they were forced to relocate to [[Holden Sylvan]]. After the [[Defeat of Kyrgall]], the [[Clerics of Hallamar]] renamed and reworked the calendar with the assistance of [[The Chronicle|Chronicle]] scryers, Chroniclers, and other mages familiar with the astrologic and astronomic arts. 

The week is divided into seven days, which are, in order: Moonday, Toilday,  Wealday, Oathday, Fireday, Starday, and Sunday.

The months consist of 28 day cycles, with the exception of the thirteenth month of Pastivus, which is 29 days long. The months, in order, are: Abadius, Calistril, Pharast, Gozran, Desnus, Sarenith, Erastus, Arodus, Rova, Lamashan, Neth, Kuthona, and Pastivus. 



Eras or ages are separations in the calendar generally after a period of many years. The progression to a new era is generally due to major political or social changes-or occasionally because of new inventions. There are five eras counting the current era. 

The Time of Darkness marks the beginning of recorded settlement in the region by humans, but the land was likely inhabited for millennia beforehand. It starts in the year -1,000, or 1,000 B.C. (Before Collection).

The Age of Collection marks the beginning of humanity's march forward in the region. The exact start date is hotly debated-some say that year zero started with the founding of the first circle of mages. Some say that it started with the foundation of Stane Brei. This age was marked by minor advancements in alchemy and magical study which allowed settlements to expand and a population boom. The age lasted until the year 150.

The Age of Anguish was started because of a sweeping plague which impacted magic users heavily. The plague was eradicated within twenty years, but the years that followed were generally peaceful. Perhaps, due to the complaints of the farmers (many of whom were made barons during the plague due to profiteering of nonmagical work), the name of Anguish stuck around even during peaceful times. Humanity continued to expand during this age, and some arcana and technological expansion was accomplished. The first trade routes with the [[Tribes of Darastrixethe]] were established in this era. The age lasted until the year 540. 

The Age of Enthronement-The record for this age is missing. It appears torn away. 

The Age of Lost Omens is the current era. An oddity for modern times, the years between 592 to 600 were not categorized into an era due to the fallout from the Defeat of Kyrgall and subsequent rebuilding.
