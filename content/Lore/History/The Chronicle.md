The Chronicle was started in the first age, the Age of Enthronement, according to the [[Holy Calendar of Breitek]]. It details the rise and fall of nations, the noteworthy discoveries, and the stories and tales of note. 

The Chroniclers are a convent of mages that have given a decade or more of service to recording or preserving the Chronicle. 

*The Autumn passes quickly. The Winter never long lingers-and often one wonders if anything of consequence can ever come to pass in the mortal realm. Darkness becomes light. Ancestors speak through the ages, but will all turn to ruin? Will desolation erase all that has been accomplished in our age? Our lives stretch before us. Most are idle and wither. But a chosen few-they strike their mark.* --Passage from the First Chronicler
