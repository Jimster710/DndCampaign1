Muldri was a fearsome dragon that nearly destroyed the ancient elven city of [[Felandryl]]. [[Renna the Elven Dragonslayer]] perished after doing battle with Muldri, but Felandryl was saved by her actions.  

It is said that the breath of Muldri could melt dwarven armor, stone, and steel. Muldri is a popular evil character in elven children's bedtime stories-most notably in the ever popular *Soul of Muldri* and *Prayer of Renna*.
