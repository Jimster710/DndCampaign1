Gnomes are a race characterized best by their inventiveness and cheerful mischief. They have pointed ears, but otherwise resemble short, beardless dwarves. Most gnomes live above ground-like the rock gnomes and forest gnomes of [[Amberridge]] and [[Holden Sylvan]], for example.

The deep gnomes, or Svirfneblin, live underground in [[The Underdark]].
