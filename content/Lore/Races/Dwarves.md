The dwarves are a strong and hardworking people that value craftsmanship and carefully upheld law and order. They can be quite stubborn, but they are passionate about most things. Dwarves can be found in underground cities in places such as the [[Tawnik Peaks]] and the [[Wehnor Range]]. They can also be found in the above ground settlements of various other races, although there seems to be friction between surface-born and mountain-born dwarves.
