Orcs are a group of strong, willful people that live in independent tribes and villages. Some of them are nomadic, but it is rumored that there are more permanent encampments. They are often met with fear and prejudice in most Human settlements. They are, however, individualists first, and thus it is inaccurate to state that all Orcs are evil, bloodthirsty maniacs. Although, as was noted by Oriana Ochoa of [[Valfelden]], it is difficult for humans to forget the Orc raids that were once commonplace throughout [[The Continent]]. 

Half-Orcs are more tenuously accepted in Human settlements. It should be noted that  the [[Dwarven Guilds]] have officially accepted all Orcs and Half Orcs as full citizens, and thus, it is not uncommon to find quite friendly Orcs living in dwarven settlements.
