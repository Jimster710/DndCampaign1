Halflings resemble humans, but are physically shorter. Some mages think that halflings are the result of a mixed ancestry of gnomish and human lines. Other mages think that halflings are simply the result of magical forces that we cannot hope to understand. Both types of mages are quite annoyed by the kinds of questions that halflings tend to ask, and the general merriment that has become stereotypical of halflings. 

Halflings can be found in the [[Holden Sylvan]], but are also somewhat common in other areas of the [[Kingdom of Breitek]].
