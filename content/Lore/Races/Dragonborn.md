The Dragonborn are a proud and noble people that hail from the lands of the [[Tribes of Darastrixethe]], which is to the East and past the [[Bay of Larglyne]]. They have draconic ancestry, and they have wide chromatic variations in scales. The various tribes have a tangled web of history. The tribes are rarely under the control of a single ruler. Their history is dotted with various conquests of neighboring draconic tribes, alliances by marriage, and succession by duel. 

It should be noted all of the Dragonborn tribes are unwavering allies when it comes to warfare against the [[Tundari]] people. 

Dragonborn are quite uncommon in the [[Kingdom of Breitek]].
