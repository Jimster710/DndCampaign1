Elves are an elegant and ancient people, and they once were the dominant force on [[The Continent]]. Some scholars state that the elves decline was due to humans, but the elves have a well documented history. The Elven peoples long lifespan gives them a predisposition to patience and existing in harmony with nature. It should be said that the elves do not believe they are a people in decline-they have maintained their numbers and their culture in a less obtrusive way than humans. 

Half-Elves are quite common in the [[Kingdom of Breitek]]. Most humans are quite proud to have elves in the family or in the bloodline, and thus there are very few prejudices against elves in the human settlements. It should be noted that dwarves and tieflings are (in general) not particularly fond of elves.
