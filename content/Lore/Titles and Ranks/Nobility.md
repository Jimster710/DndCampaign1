The nobility or the nobles are part of the ruling social structure in the [[Kingdom of Breitek]]. These titles (in order of most influence to least) include duke, marquess, and earl. An earl may only control a small keep or a rather large hall with a couple of nearby villages, but a duke must control at least a sizable keep and at most an entire [[Stane]].
