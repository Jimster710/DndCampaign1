Captain is generally a military rank which refers either to a front-line combat leader in land forces or a rank which denotes command of an oceangoing naval vessel. 

In less formal groups, such as pirates, smugglers, and traders-captain is often used as a title (not a rank) to refer to the leader of any vessel.
