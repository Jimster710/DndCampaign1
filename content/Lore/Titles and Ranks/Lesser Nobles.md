Lesser Nobles are considered by many to not be part of the nobility structure at all. However, they have enough power to be considered part of the ruling hierarchy in the [[Kingdom of Breitek]]. Some think that the titles are granted simply so that the [[Nobility]] and in turn the [[Royalty]] can control larger areas. Lesser Nobles can be barons, viscounts, [[Lord|lords]], or ladies.
