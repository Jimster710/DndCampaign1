The Clerics of Hallamar are an order of clerics at the service of the [[Kingdom of Breitek]]. They are based out of [[Stane Hallamar]]. 

The Clerics of Hallamar are in charge of most religious matters in the Kingdom-from the foundation of temples and the collection of offerings to the creation of healing potions and the evaluation of Relics and Basilicas.

[[Cleric Hale]] is a former Cleric of Hallamar, now he is working with [[RotThorn]].

A somewhat niche collection of monster cards has been produced by the Clerics of Hallamar under the pretense of warning the general populace about the dangers of the various creatures that threaten the Kingdom. In reality, this collection of cards has turned into one of the few approved forms of entertainment for the Clerics. 

A game can be played with these cards-unofficially of course. The game has been nicknamed *Relics & Beasts*.
