Myastan Balasar is a [[Dragonborn]] Paladin. He hails from the mighty tribe of the green dragonborn, part of the [[Tribes of Darastrixethe]]. He is 15 years old and stands at 6'5". He is an excellent survivalist, and has spent many a moon in the wilds during his time of wandering. He has left the wilderness to save others, in the true fashion of all honorable paladins. He will soon take the Oath of Devotion.

Balasar has found:
A gray cloth bag secured with a golden twine drawstring. Various animals have came out of it, and it seems like it is getting rather light.
A set of Adamantine Chain Mail, which once belonged to Renna the famed Elven warrior. Balasar has equipped this armor.
Two scrolls of nature magic. One of Entanglement, and one of Wither and Bloom.
