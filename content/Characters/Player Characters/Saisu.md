Saisu is a [[Dragonborn]] Paladin. He hails from the mighty tribe of the white dragonborn, part of the [[Tribes of Darastrixethe]]. He is 25 years old and stands at 7 feet tall. He served as a Katima (the rank of SGT.) in the tribe's army. He has since left the tribal lands to seek battles worthy of his experience, so that he may one day be mentioned in the tales of heroes that he grew up with. Oath of Vengeance.
