You met and defeated the Druidess Goblin at the farm of [[The Old Man of Lochfeld]].

She is not very fond of Capybaras. She loves her vulture. 

Death did not contain the Druidess. She returned to her [[Druidess Goblin Lair|lair]], now undead. She was able to slip away from the party through a magical pedestal. The glowing purple runes on the pedestal remind the party of their shared dream. 

The Druidess was killed (again) at [[content/Locations/Kingdom of Breitek/Dungeons, Caves, and Dangers/Muldri's Rest|Muldri's Rest]] before her ritual could be completed.
