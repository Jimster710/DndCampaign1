Draft: false

You met and defeated the Druidess Goblin at the farm of [[The Old Man of Lochfeld]].

She is not very fond of Capybaras. She loves her vulture. 

Death did not contain the Druidess. She returned to her [[Druidess Goblin Lair|lair]], now undead. She was able to slip away from the party through a magical pedestal. The glowing purple runes on the pedestal remind the party of their shared dream. 

How has she returned from death? What are her true goals? Will that damned vulture ever die for real?
