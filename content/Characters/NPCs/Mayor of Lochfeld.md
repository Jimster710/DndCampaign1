The leader of the village of [[Lochfeld]]. 

[[Capt. Staro]] does not seem to like him much. [[Chatz the Barkeep]] thinks he parties too hard, even for him.

Chadith is the Mayor's name, which [[Zalma Cindershine|Zalma]] discovered by using [[Nyx]] to search through [[Lady Sturmlith|Lady Sturmlith's]] files. He is generally referred to only as "The Mayor", and he is the only one running in the Lochfeld Mayoral election on the 25th of Pharast. 

The [[The High Priestess of Lochfeld]] has refused to endorse him in the upcoming election. 

[[Radamis]] is one of the aldermen that assists the Mayor.
