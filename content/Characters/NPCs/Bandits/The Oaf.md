Title: The Oaf

An oafish (idiot, moron) male voice was in your dream. You found the man with this voice in the [[Druidess Goblin Lair]], and he is one of [[RotThorn|RotThorn's]] bandits! 

[[Capt. Ros]] said that the Oaf was sent in to the ranks of the Goblins and Bandits in order to discover why they are abducting people (and cows) from [[Lochfeld]]. The hope was that the Oaf's stupidity would make him a perfect spy, as no one would suspect him. Unfortunately, the Oaf's bald head is largely ornamental. 

The Oaf was told telepathically by a pseudodragon that [[Renna the Elven Dragonslayer]] must be saved. The Oaf was present with the Druidess and a hooded figure during the party's shared abduction. 

It seems as though, through [[Myastan Balasar|Balasar's]] confrontation with the [[Druidess Goblin]] in the crystal ball, that the Oaf's death was important to the Druidess. 
The Oaf survived the battle of [[Muldri's Rest]]. He is particularly fond of Bobbert.  

The Silent Mage used some of the remaining magical energy from the failed ritual to regenerate The Oaf's mind. Apparently, his real name is **Arvind Krabicka**, and he claims to remember things from long ago, but not so long ago as when [[Renna the Elven Dragonslayer]] was around.

> To be honest, he was easier to deal with when he was just an idiot.
