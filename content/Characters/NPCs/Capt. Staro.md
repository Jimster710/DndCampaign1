[[Captain]] Staro is the head of the town guard in [[Lochfeld]]. She can be rough around the edges, but she will defend the town with her life. She does not care much for the [[Mayor of Lochfeld|mayor]], and dislikes [[Radamis]] to a deeper degree. 

Capt. Staro is a ranger of the [[Order of Feathers]]. 

[[Yosim Standengarden]] & [[Myastan Balasar]] met Capt. Staro near the blacksmith shop and broken palisade in [[Lochfeld]]. She gave you a wanted poster for [[RotThorn]]. She also pointed out the likely location of the goblin lair. 

> Balasar learned that she is stronger than she looks. And she looked quite strong from his view from the ground.

Capt. Staro has agreed to assist the party with their investigation into the Altar Boy. 

Balasar and Capt. Staro have a sparring appointment on the 26th of Pharast at 11 in the morning, a couple of hours before the election.
