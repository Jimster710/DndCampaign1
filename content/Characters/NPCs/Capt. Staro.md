[[Captain]] Staro is the head of the town guard in [[Lochfeld]]. She can be rough around the edges, but she will defend the town with her life. She does not care much for the [[Mayor of Lochfeld|mayor]], and dislikes [[Radamis]] to a deeper degree. 

Capt. Staro is a ranger of the [[Order of Feathers]]. 

You met Capt. Staro near the blacksmith shop and broken palisade in [[Lochfeld]]. She gave you a wanted poster for [[RotThorn]]. She also pointed out the likely location of the goblin lair.
