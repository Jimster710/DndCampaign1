Idril is a half-elf [[Order of Feathers]] ranger that is under the command of [[Capt. Staro]] of the [[Lochfeld]] town guard. He tailed the party under orders from Capt. Staro and requested that [[Myastan Balasar]] and [[Saisu]] bend the truth when sending a message back to [[Radamis]]. 

He told them that they should say that the [[Druidess Goblin]] was defeated and work in a code phrase, "[[Chatz Tavern]]", into the message so that Capt. Staro can send assistance and determine if Radamis or the [[Mayor of Lochfeld|Mayor]] is working against the interests of the town.
