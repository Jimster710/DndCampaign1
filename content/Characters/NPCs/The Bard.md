Title: The Bard
Draft: false

The Bard is the son of [[The Old Man of Lochfeld]]. He barged into [[Chatz Tavern]] and was ranting and raving about an abduction. He was dragged away by the town guards under the command of [[Radamis]]. 

Perhaps his exterior decorating skills are not his strong suit. 

He is currently being held in the [[Lochfeld]] Dungeon.
