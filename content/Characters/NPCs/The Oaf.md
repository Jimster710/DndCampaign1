An oafish (idiot, moron) male voice was in your dream. You found the man with this voice in the [[Druidess Goblin Lair]], and he is one of [[RotThorn|RotThorn's]] bandits! 

[[Capt. Ros]] said that the Oaf was sent in to the ranks of the Goblins and Bandits in order to discover why they are abducting people (and cows) from [[Lochfeld]]. The hope was that the Oaf's stupidity would make him a perfect spy, as no one would suspect him. Unfortunately, the Oaf's bald head is largely ornamental.
