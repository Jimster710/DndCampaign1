Ser Skald is the brutal commander of the [[Bandit Encampment]] while [[RotThorn]] is absent. He is a half-orc, and his preference for violence is well known. He is guarded by a Tiefling woman and a full elf man, both of whom look quite formidable in their own right. 

He has struck a deal with the party-he will use his forces to assist in defeating the [[Druidess Goblin]], but he stressed that the party must follow his orders. Any hint of betrayal will be met with brutality. 

Ser Skald was captured at the [[Bandit Encampment]] and dragged to [[Muldri's Rest]] where the [[Druidess Goblin]] turned him into an undead thrall.
