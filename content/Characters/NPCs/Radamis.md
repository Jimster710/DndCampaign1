Radamis is the [[Alderman]] of the village of [[Lochfeld]]. He assists the [[Mayor of Lochfeld]] with financial matters. 

You met him at [[Chatz Tavern]] where he asked you to look in on [[The Old Man of Lochfeld]]. He mentioned a reward and left a paper detailing the work in writing. 

He doesn't seem too fond of [[Capt. Staro]]. He also seems to be extremely bored-and quite standoffish.
