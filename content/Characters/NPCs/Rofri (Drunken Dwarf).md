Rofri is the drunken dwarf that the party found and dragged through the [[Druidess Goblin Lair]]. He is constantly drunk or trying to get drunk. The only time he is not drunk is when he is sleeping off his drunkenness. He told [[Capt. Ros]] of [[RotThorn|RotThorn's]] Bandits that the party seemed to kill Goblins, Bandits working with the Goblins, and RotThorn's Bandits indiscriminately.
