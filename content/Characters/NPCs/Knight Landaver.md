Knight Landaver is a human paladin that [[Saisu]] faced in open and "fair" combat after he called Saisu out for a one-on-one duel of honor. 

Knight Landaver proceeded to sub in his squire [[Gregly]] after failing to hit Saisu, which brought [[Myastan Balasar]] into the fray. 

He was swiftly defeated and then mocked for his dishonorable conduct. He healed the party and then gifted them a 1d4 healing potion. Gregly was traumatized. Knight Landaver will likely continue to follow his oath (in his own special way) to find and defeat evil, where-ever it may hide, in whatever weather there may be, no matter how many squires may perish!

The party met Knight Landaver again near [[Muldri's Rest]], where he dropped Gregly into the foggy chasm below. Were it not for the bravery of [[Myastan Balasar]], Gregly would have perished.
