Capt. Ros was one of [[RotThorn|RotThorn's]] bandits. He was sent to the [[Druidess Goblin Lair]] to defeat the [[Druidess Goblin]], and to determine the purpose behind the abductions in [[Lochfeld]]. 

After losing most of his men, recovering [[The Oaf]] and [[Rofri (Drunken Dwarf)]], and losing his only goblin hostage, he agreed that the best course of action was to take [[Yosim Standengarden]] & [[Zalma Cindershine]] to the nearby [[Bandit Encampment]].

Capt. Ros met his end once he was "disarmed" by Ser Skald.
