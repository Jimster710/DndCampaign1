RotThorn is a dangerous and powerful bandit leader that has taken up permanent residence somewhere near [[Lochfeld]]. Stories have spread regarding the cruelty of RotThorn, but few have ever seen RotThorn and lived to tell the tale.

You received a wanted poster for RotThorn from [[Capt. Staro]]. There is no picture included on the poster.

RotThorn left [[Ser Skald]] in charge of the [[Bandit Encampment]]. He left orders for the bandits that they should secure the power of [[Renna the Elven Dragonslayer|Renna]] for him after defeating the [[Druidess Goblin]]. 

RotThorn apparently ordered [[Stanley]] to dispatch of one of his Lieutenants that failed to defend the Bandit Encampment or defeat the Druidess Goblin.
