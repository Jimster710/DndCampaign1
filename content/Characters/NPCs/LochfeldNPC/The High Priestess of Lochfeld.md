The High Priestess of Lochfeld is in charge of the town's chapter of the [[Clerics of Hallamar]] and is the spiritual leader of the temple of Lochfeld. 

[[Myastan Balasar]] and [[Yosim Standengarden]] met the High Priestess and bought a health potion off of her. Balasar, by virtue of pursuing his Paladin oath, received the priestess' blessing. She seems to believe in his potential. 

She also informed Yosim and Balasar that she refuses to endorse the [[Mayor of Lochfeld]] in the upcoming election because of his habit of visiting [[Lady Sturmlith's Brothel]].

The High Priestess is particularly miffed at Balasar for causing such a ruckus while a troop of the [[Clerics of Hallamar]] were visiting the temple of Lochfeld and deciding on whether or not to upgrade the temple to a minor basilica.
