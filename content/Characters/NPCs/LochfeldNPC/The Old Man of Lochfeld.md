The Old Man of Lochfeld is an elderly male human who lives just outside of the palisade wall in Lochfeld. His son is [[The Bard]], and he seems to not get along with him too well. He takes naps in the hidden crawlspace underneath his farmhouse to avoid his son. The outside of his cozy farmhouse was clearly decorated by [[The Bard]], and The Old Man of Lochfeld can't stand that. 

He wants to be left alone, and he now has a prized stone in his entryway that speaks these words to every new visitor: "Get the hell out of my house!"
