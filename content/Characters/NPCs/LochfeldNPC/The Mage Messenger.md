Title: The Mage Messenger
Draft: false

The Mage Messenger is a member of the Lochfeld guard. He was previously assigned to man [[The Mountain Outpost]], before it was destroyed by [[Myastan Balasar]]. He hates his job, seems to get assigned to the worst duties, and he is constantly reminded of the fact that he is not lucky enough to have been born into a family of [[Lesser Nobles]].  

It is safe to say that Balasar and [[Saisu]] are on his shit-list. He informed Capt. Staro (and gods know who else) of the destruction of the outpost. It appears that he is sharing the blame with the [[Mayor of Lochfeld]] for raising false alarm regarding an attack on Lochfeld that never came.
