Lady Sturmlith is an older human matron, but still quite beautiful. She is the proprietor of [[Lochfeld|Lochfeld's]] notorious establishment, [[Lady Sturmlith's Brothel]], and is always interested in finding new talent for her brothel.  

She seems to be quite involved in Lochfeld's politics. [[Zalma Cindershine]] discovered that the [[Mayor of Lochfeld]] has a massive unpaid bill at this establishment!

She sent Zalma a beautiful perfume bottle along with a message. She requires assistance  of some sort after this business with the druidess and the election is cleared up.
